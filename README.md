### Highlight Features:
* Rendering all spots: The home page is of the application will render every spot in the database as well as those that are later added by users
* Creating a spot: When a user is logged in, a button will appear in the navbar that will allow the user to create their very own spot and be added to the list of already existing spots.
* Editing a spot: If the logged in user owns a spot on the application a button on the spots page will appear that will allow them to edit the details of that owned spot.
* Deleting a spot: If they so choose the owner of the spot can delete that location from the application and they will be redirected to the home page on delete.


* Rendering all reviews: When a user navigates to a single spot page all the reviews for that spot will be displayed below the details of that spot.
* Creating a review: When a user is logged in, below the displayed reviews, there will be an input field allowing the user to leave a review, along with a star rating from 1-5.
* Deleting a review: When the logged in user that left a review wishes to delete their review they may do so a the click of a button. The average rating a number of reviews will update accordingly.
